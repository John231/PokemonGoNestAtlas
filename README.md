# PokemonGoNestAtlas
Nest atlas for Pokemon Go

The idea for this app was to learn a bit more about parsing JSON and the MapKit framework. What better way than combining the two and creating a local Pokémon nest map for the town of York, UK. This app was programmed using swift 3.1 and is suitable for devices running iOS 9.3 or later.

The nest data for this app was sourced from The Silph Road global nest atlas (https://thesilphroad.com/atlas#15/53.9531/-1.0566) [Accessed 19.06.2017]
with many thanks to the Silph Road site. Note this is not an official app and is for personal educational purposes only so that I could learn a bit more about parsing JSON and creating custom maps with MapKit.

Please feel free to send feedback, comments or suggestions to me!
